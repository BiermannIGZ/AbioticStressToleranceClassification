Dear reader, 
the R code was used to conduct the study "Discovering tolerance â€“ a computational approach to assess abiotic stress tolerance in tomato" and is designe classify tolerance against abiotic stresses. The code is written to be applicable to a variety of diverse raw data sets. Updates to promote usability can be observed within the commits to the code.
